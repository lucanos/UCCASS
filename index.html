        <article id="introduction"><h3><a href="#toc">Introduction</a></h3>

          <p>The Unit Command Climate Assessment and Survey System (UCCASS) (pronounced yoo-kas)
            is a PHP survey script used to make general purpose surveys or questionnaires. Originally designed
            for the government, this program is intended to automate the Command Climate
            Assessment surveys that unit commanders are required to give but it can also
            be used for general purpose surveys and polls.</p>

          <article id="features"><h4><a href="#toc">Features</a></h4>

            <p>The key features of this survey program are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Web-based Installation</li>
              <li>Template based presentation using the <a href="http://smarty.php.net">Smarty Template Engine</a></li>
              <li>Database abstraction layer using <a href="http://adodb.sourceforge.net">ADOdb</a>,
                enabling the Survey System to be used with multiple databases (Survey System
                is only tested with MySQL at this time, though)</li>
              <li>Unlimited surveys, unlimited questions per survey and unlimited answer types.
                Theme based system allows surveys to have their own look and feel once new themes
                are made.</li>
              <li>Complete access control system allowing for the
                creation of multiple administrator users, public or private access to creating surveys,
                multiple users with individual permissions to take surveys, view results, and edit surveys.
                Access to surveys and results can be unrestricted (public), or restricted by IP address,
                cookies, username and password or invitation only (invitation sent by email).</li>
              <li>Access to taking surveys can be restricted
                to a certain number of times over a given period, i.e. <em>&quot;Allow users to
                take 1 survey every 7 days.&quot;</em>.</li>
              <li>Surveys can be completely hidden and not show up
                on the main page at all. Access to the surveys is possible by using a unique
                URL, though, that can be delivered through email, for example. This could allow you
                to run multiple surveys with multiple users and not advertise what each of them are.</li>
              <li>Individual surveys have username and password protected administration area for activating
                or deactivating surveys, setting all properties, and editing questions and messages. Multiple
                users can be created with access to edit surveys.</li>
              <li>Administrative and per-survey level setting allow question, answer values, and
                user supplied text to be rendered as plain text, limited HTML or full HTML.
              <li>Surveys can be marked as Active or Inactive or given specific start and end
                dates</li>
              <li>Administrator password allows access to edit all surveys, answer types, and
                view results of any survey</li>
              <li>Questions can have text or multiple choice answers. Multiple choice answers
                can be presented horizontally, vertically, in a HTML drop down or a Matrix (grid).</li>
              <li>Questions can be can be marked as required or left optional</li>
              <li>Questions can be optionally hidden or required based upon answers to previous
                questions (called dependencies)</li> with unlimited dependencies per question</li>
              <li>Survey results are presented in bar graphs showing percentage of answers
                for each value. Each answer value can be assigned an image to be used for it's
                bar graph.</li>
              <li>Specific questions can be temporarily hidden from the results page so you
                only see the questions you want</li>
              <li>Survey results can be filtered based upon the results of any question, i.e.
                if you have a Gender question, you can filter the results to see just how Females
                answered your survey to look for trends. Survey results can be viewed in a &quot;table&quot;
                format which shows each response on it's own table row. Results can also be exported
                to a CSV file for further processing. Individual text answers that are inappropriate
                can be deleted from the results.</li>
              <li>Admin controlled &quot;filter limit&quot; to prevent survey results being
                shown if the results are narrowed down to 3 or less (by default) distinct respondents
                (this is to maintain anonymity of the users who take your survey, so that the
                results can not be filtered to such a degree as to identify</li>
              <li>New surveys can be created by copying existing surveys, so there will be
                no need to rewrite all of the questions and recreate answer types and values. New empty
                surveys receive a default set of answer types and values.</li>

                      enabled, IIS will run as the <em><strong>IUSR_&lt;computer_name&gt; </strong></em>user,
                      where &lt;computer_name&gt; is the actual name of the server. Right-click
                      on the <em><strong>survey.ini.php</strong></em> file, choose the Security
                      tab, and give the appropriate user permission to read and write to the file.
                      If you are using NTLM based access, then you'll have to give the individual
                      user or group installing this program access to read and write the file.</li>

                  If you choose a new installation, <strong>any existing data in the database you specify
                  will be lost</strong>. If you choose to upgrade, your existing database will be modified
                  to include any new column additions and/or data.</li>
              <li>Fill out the remainder of the form according to your settings and save the data.
                  See Site Settings for an explanation of each setting. After saving
                  the data, the <em><strong>survey.ini.php</strong></em> file will be written
                  with the new data and the tables and initial data will be created or updated.</li>
              <li>At this point, it is recommended you remove write permissions for the from
                  the <em><strong>survey.ini.php</strong></em> file so your settings are not overwritten.</li>
              <li>You must move or rename the<em><strong> install.php</strong></em> file so
                  the installation procedure cannot be run again unless you choose to do so. The
                  program will not run if <em><strong>install.php</strong></em> is present.</li>
              <li>If you are using the version of Smarty included with this distribution,

              <li>Place all files into a directory under your web root.</li>
              <li>If you are installing the database tables into a new database, create the
                  database.</li>
              <li>If this is a new installation, the <strong>survey.sql file</strong> contains the table definitions and
                  initial data. You must import this file into the database you created in Step
                  2. With MySQL, this is normally done from the command line with a &quot;<em><strong>mysql
                  -u</strong></em>user<em><strong> -p</strong></em>password<em><strong> </strong></em>database_name<em><strong>
                  &lt; survey.sql</strong></em>&quot; command (where user, password, and database_name
                  are the actual values for your server). If you or your host provides a program
                  like PHPMyAdmin, then the file can be imported through there, also.</li>
              <li>If this is an upgrade, it is recommended you use the web-based installation process. If using
                  the manual process, each upgrade file in the /upgrades/ folder must be run to bring your database
                  up to date. upgrade_104_105.php must be run to upgrade from v1.04 to v1.05, for example. You must
                  run all of the files in sequence until you get to the version you are upgrading to.</li>
              <li>Table prefixes are not supported when doing a manual installation unless
                  you physically rename each of the tables to include the prefix and then include
                  that prefix into the <em><strong>survey.ini.php</strong></em> file.</li>
              <li>Edit the fields in the <em><strong>survey.ini.php</strong></em> file to
                  match the setting of your site and server. See Site Settings for
                  an explanation of each setting in the <em><strong>survey.ini.php</strong></em>
                  file.</li>
              <li>You must move or rename the <em><strong>install.php</strong></em> file that
                  is used for web-based installation. The program will not run if <strong><em>install.php</em></strong>
                  is present.</li>
              <li>If you are using the version of Smarty included with this distribution,

              <p>To upgrade from v1.04 to v1.05, all files associated with the old version must be deleted. The v1.04 templates
                and <strong><em>survey.ini.php</em></strong> file are not compatible with with v1.05 because of the extensive changes. All of your
                existing surveys and results will not be removed if you choose Upgrade during the installation process.
                Choosing a New Installation <strong>will remove any existing data you have</strong> if you give the
                same configuration data. Once the v1.04 files have been removed, copy the v1.05 files in their place
                and follow the <a href="#installation_webbased">Web Based Installation</a>
                or <a href="#installation_manual">Manual Installation</a> instructions.</p>

            <article id="installation_upgrade105_106"><h5>Upgrade from v1.05 to v1.06</h5>

              <p>If you are using the default templates with v1.05, you can upgrade by simply copying all of the v1.06 files
               and overwriting the v1.05 files. There were no database changes nor configuratin file changes, so the installation
               sequence does not need to be ran.<br />
               If you are using customized templates and wish to keep them, you need to update four of them to fix bugs. There
               are only five files with differences between the two versions, so begin by copying the new v1.06 <strong>survey.class.php</strong>
               file and overwriting the v1.05 version. From the v1.06 files, the following four templates must be copied
               and placed in each of your template directories. You will need to go back and customize them again after this is done.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>take_survey_question_MM_V.tpl</li>

              </ul>
              <p>These files are located in the <strong>templates/Default/</strong> directory of the v1.06 files.</p>

            <article id="installation_upgrade106_180"><h5>Upgrade from v1.06 to v1.8.0</h5>

              <p>There were quite a few changes regarding permissions with v1.8.0, so many of the templates for older
                versions will not work and will have to be updated. To upgrade, copy all of the v1.8.0 files to your
                directory and run that installation program. Because of the access control changes, after the upgrade,
                any existing surveys will be marked as public (no access control) and results access will be private
                (admin only, since that's the only user, now). It's advised that you log in as the default admin user
                (Login: admin, Password: password) and immediately change the password. You can then go about resetting
                the access controls for each of existing surveys. <strong>No survey data will be lost</strong> during
                the upgrade except for the previous access control settings.</p>

            <article id="installation_upgrade180_181"><h5>Upgrade from v1.8.0 to v1.8.0</h5>

              <p>Version 1.8.1 is a minor upgrade that includes support for multiple character sets for foreign languages
                and also fixes an annoying bug regarding quotes when adding answer values. Before upgrading from a previous
                version, take notes regarding your settings in the <strong>survey.ini.php</strong> file because v1.8.1 includes
                a new version of that file. To upgrade, delete all of the old UCCASS files (except any custom templates you may
                have created) and copy the new files to your directory. Run the <strong>install.php</strong> file and re-enter
                all of your settings that you copied from the old <strong>survey.ini.php</strong> file. The will see the new
                option to choose a character set for your installation and the available options. In the drop down at the top of
                the page, choose whether you are upgrading from a previous version or performing a new installation. Upgrading from
                any previous version will not remove any existing surveys or results. If you are upgrading from a version prior
                to v1.8.0, read the notices above for each new version to see what changes will be made. After running the installation
                program, delete the install.php file and UCCASS will be ready to use.</p>

          <article id="available_surveys"><h4>Available Surveys</h4>

            <p>The first view of the survey system will show you the available public and
              private surveys and an interface to edit existing surveys. Surveys can be in
              any number of states. To begin with, surveys must be marked as active or inactive.
              Only surveys marked as active will be available. Survey creators can also give
              start and end dates to control when the survey automatically becomes active
              or inactive.</p>
            <p>Once active, surveys can be marked as public or private. Public surveys will
              be available to anyone visiting the site. To complete a public survey, simply
              click on the name of the survey listed. Private surveys will require a password,
              however. There is one password for the survey and anyone entering the correct
              password will be allowed to take the survey. Enter the password in the text
              box and click the button to begin taking the survey.</p>
            <p>The two final states of a survey deal with the results. Results can also be
              marked public or private and share the same features as public or private surveys.
              To view public results, there will be a link you can click on after the name
              of the survey. To view private results, you must enter the password in the results
              area text box and click the button.</p>
            <p>Once viewing the results, any user will be able to use the results features
              of filtering questions and the ability to group, hide, or show certain questions
              according to their likes. This applies to public and private results and is
              specific to the individual user. In other words, if one user filters a survey
              to just include Male results, it will not affect how other users have chosen
              to view the results.</p>

          </article>
          
          <article id="create_new_survey"><h4>Creating A New Survey</h4>

            <p>To create a new survey you will need to have a unique, descriptive name for
              the survey and a password. You are encouraged to use a very descriptive name
              so people who are looking for your survey will be able to find it easily and
              so it will not be confused with other surveys. The password is required in case
              you need to edit your survey at a later date. This password is different from
              the passwords required to take the survey or view the survey results, if you
              decide to make the survey or results private.</p>
            <p>The first step to creating a new survey will be different depending upon the
              template your site is running. The default template includes a link on the main
              page to allow any user to create a new survey. Some administrators may choose
              to remove and disable this link so that only specific people can create a new
              survey. If you do not see a link or button regarding creating a new survey on
              the main page of the survey site, then ask the site administrator for instructions.</p>
            <p>Once you have access to the wizard to create a new survey, you will need to
              provide the survey name and password mentioned earlier in the text boxes. The
              third optional part to creating a survey is choosing whether you want to copy
              an existing survey or not. You can choose to begin with a blank survey and define
              all questions, answers, and dependencies yourself or you can copy a survey already
              made. If you choose to copy a survey, all questions, answer types and values,
              and dependencies of the survey will be recreated for the new survey, however,
              the results will NOT be copied to your survey. Your survey will begin with zero
              results.</p>
            <p>Once you have supplied the requested data, click on the link or button for
              the next step. At this point the survey is created with either default or copied
              data. The procedure of creating a new survey from this point on is the same
              as editing an existing survey as described in <a href="#edit_surveys">Editing Surveys</a>.
              You can adjust the survey properties, add or edit questions
              and dependencies and also create new or edit existing answer types and values.</p>

          </article>
          
          <article id="edit_surveys"><h4>Editing Surveys</h4>

            <p>Surveys have four main sections when they are being edited. The first section
              deals with the survey properties. Here you can edit the welcome and thank you
              text, activate your survey, and adjust any passwords. The second section deals
              with questions, both adding new questions and editing existing questions. This
              area is also where you'll define dependencies among the questions.</p>
            <p>The third section deals with editing answer types and values. Within the survey system, you define
              a specific answer type of a text box, multiple choice, etc, and give the answer
              values if appropriate. Then, when adding or editing questions, you'll choose
              from the defined answer values for each question. Normally an answer type is
              used for multiple questions, so it's easier to create these separately.</p>
            <p>The fourth section of editing surveys, access control, will control who has access
              to the surveys and how they get access.</p>
            <p>The links along the top of the page control access to each of the different
              sections of editing a survey.</p>
          
            <article id="survey_properties"><h5>Survey Properties</h5>

              <p>The properties of your survey control what users see when the first start taking
                your survey and when they complete it. They also control access to your survey
                and provide some administrative functions for clearing or deleting your survey.
                After you have made any changes to the survey properties, don't forget to click
                the save changes button at the bottom of the page before moving into any other
                sections.</p>
              
              <article id="ep_name"><h6>Survey Name and Creation Date</h6>

                <p>The survey name was already given when you created the survey, but this will
                  allow you to edit the name is necessary. Remember that if you change the name
                  too drastically, users may not be able to find the survey. The creation date
                  lists the date this survey was initially created. This field is not editable
                  and just serves are a reminder or notice of how old the survey is.</p>
              
              </article>
              
              <article id="ep_active"><h6>Active and Inactive Status</h6>

                <p>You can use these properties to manually turn your survey on or off. Making
                  the survey active will cause it to appear in the public or private available
                  survey list. The survey must have at least one question in order to be activated.
                  If the survey has been given a start date then the survey will
                  not actually become active until that date arrives. If you have specified a
                  start date yet want the survey to be active immediately, you must remove the
                  start date from the previous property. Making a survey inactive will disable
                  anyone from completing the survey. The results of the survey are only available
                  if the survey is active. Making a survey inactive will not remove any results,
                  however.</p>

              <article id="ep_dates"><h6>Start and End Date</h6>

                <p>After you are through creating your survey, you can use the start and end date
                  area to specify when the survey should become active and inactive. At midnight
                  on the start date, the survey will appear in the public or private area depending
                  upon the survey properties. It will be marked as inactive at 23:59 on the end
                  date that you specify. Dates must be given in a YYYY-MM-DD format, such as 2004-01-20
                  for January 20th, 2004. Also note that the start and end dates you give will
                  override the active or inactive status.</p>

              <article id="ep_template"><h6>Survey Template</h6>

                <p>Each survey can be assigned a template to control the looks and layout. While
                  the main site and available survey list can be assigned one template, the system
                  you designate here will be used for people taking the survey and viewing the
                  results. You may wish to create different templates to go along with the questions
                  and audience of your surveys or use the same template for all surveys on your
                  site.</p>

                <p>These settings control the rendering of text supplied for the survey properties,
                  questions, answer values, and user supplied text. The Survey Text Mode setting
                  applies to any text used to create the survey, such as name, questions, and answer values.
                  User Text Mode applied to any text supplied by users as they answer the surveys. If you
                  do not have any text answers in your survey, then the User Text Mode will not affect anything.
                  There are three options for each mode, although an administrator might have restricted the

                  <li>Limited HTML: This mode will allow the use of b, i, u, div, span, a, and img HTML tags
                      with restrictions on what attributes can be used with each tag. The restriction on attributes
                      is enforced so that <i>onchange</i>, <i>onmouseover</i>, etc JavaScript code cannot be injected
                      into these limited HTML tags. This is the recommended setting for Survey Text Mode so that
                      you can use additional formatting within your questions and answer values.</li>
                  <li>Full HTML: <strong>Warning:</strong> Full HTML is a security risk unless used in a controlled
                      environment. The Full HTML setting will render any and all HTML, JavaScript, DHTML, etc that's
                      supplied in the text. In a controlled environment, this may be useful for including tables, code examples,
                      etc within your surveys, but it can be abused. Injected JavaScript could be used to steal cookies,
                      redirect users, and change any page content. This setting should <strong>never</strong> be used
                      for the User Text Mode.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These settings can be changed back and forth after the survey has been created. If you use Limited HTML
                  and create a question that includes images, for example, then switch to Text Only, the actual HTML code
                  will be displayed within the question and not rendered in the browser. The user will see &lt;b&gt;bold text&lt;/b&gt;
                  instead of <b>bold text</b>.</p>
                <p>With the Limited HTML and Full HTML options, you have two placeholders that you can use in your questions
                  and/or answers. The first is {$html} will will resolve to the HTTP address of your current installation such
                  as http://www.bigredspark.com/survey. {$images_html} will resolve to the images folder of the current template
                  such as http://www.bigredspark.com/survey/templates/Default/images. So if you wanted to make a link to another survey
                  within a question, you could use &lt;a href=&quot;{$html}/survey.php?sid=55&quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;. If you
                  wanted to include images in your questions or answer values, you can place them in the images/ folder of your
                  template and refer to them as &lt;img src=&quot;{$images_html}/aquabar.gif&quot;&gt;. If you change templates, you
                  do not have to change these placeholders so long as the images are also available in the new template. Users can
                  also use these placeholder in their answers but it's up to you to inform them (or rather not inform them) of their
                  ability to use them.</p>

              <article id="ep_redirect"><h6>Completion Redirect Page</h6>

                <p>This setting allows you to set an action to take when the user has completed the survey. There are three options:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Main Survey Page: This will redirect the user back to the index.php (available surveys list) upon completing
                      the survey.</li>
                  <li>Survey Results Page: This will redirect the user to the results page when they complete the survey. This setting
                      should only be used if the results are public, otherwise the user will get a notice that the results require a password.</li>
                  <li>Custom URL: You can also provide a complete URL including http:// or https:// to redirect the user to upon
                      completion. This can be used to redirect the user to your own custom thank you page or back to the main page
                      for your own site (instead of the survey system main page).</li>

                <p>This is a date format string used to format the dates in the Table and CSV results
                  views. This date format must match the specifications given for the
                  <a href="http://www.php.net/date">PHP date()</a> function. Default value is
                  <strong>Y-m-d H:i:s</strong> but can be changed in the <i>survey.ini.php</i>
                  file or during the installation process.</p>

              <article id="ep_time_limit"><h6>Time Limit</h6>

                <p>This is an optional time limit in minutes that can be imposed on your survey.
                  The user taking your survey is informed of the time limit and the approximate time
                  elapsed on each page of the survey. If the user exceeds the time limit, the last page
                  entered is not saved into the database. Because there is no automatic submission of the
                  survey when the time limit is exceeded the system simply rejects the last page even
                  though some of the questions may have been answered within the time limit. For this reason,
                  it's recommended you use as many pages as possible when using a survey with a time limit
                  to prevent valid answers from being rejected.</p>

                  change any questions or answer types or values of the survey, it simply clears
                  the existing results. After developing and testing your survey, this option
                  is useful to clear out all of the test results to prepare the survey to go live</p>

              <p>This section allows you to add new or edit existing questions within your survey.
                You will also assign answer types to questions and control dependencies and
                question layout here. If you are creating a new survey and choose to start with
                a blank survey, you will not see any questions listed. If you chose to copy
                another survey that had questions already made or are editing an existing survey,
                you should see a list of questions.</p>
                
              <article id="question_list"><h6>The Question List</h6>

                <p>The question list shows all of the questions in the survey in the order that
                  the users will see them. This section allows you to jump to an edit page for
                  individual questions, delete questions, and move questions up or down. Page
                  breaks are also listed, but they are not assigned a question number. Any questions
                  that have an N type answer will be given an L1, L2, etc question number. These
                  questions are not actually assigned numbers when taking the survey, but giving them
                  an Lx label allows you to insert questions following these.</p>
                <p>The first column gives the question or label number followed by the actual text of the
                  question in the next column. If the question has any dependencies, you'll see
                  them listed under the question text. For example, if a question about fishing
                  is given a dependency of being hidden to females answering the survey, you'll
                  see a dependency such as &quot;<em><strong>Hide if question X is Female</strong></em>&quot;.</p>
                <p>The buttons to the right of each question text allow you to edit the question,
                  delete the question, or move it up and down. If you choose to edit the question,
                  you'll be taken to another page where you can adjust all of the question properties.
                  If you delete the question, it cannot be retrieved. The results to that question
                  are also deleted along with the text. You can move a question up or down in
                  the list by simply clicking on the appropriate arrow button.</p>
                <p>For any page breaks shown in the question list, you only have the option of
                  deleting it. If you wish to move a page break up or down, simply move the questions
                  surrounding the page break in the appropriate direction.</p>

              <article id="new_question"><h6>Adding A New Question</h6>

                <p>At the bottom of the question list is a form that allows you to add new questions
                  and page breaks to the survey. It is here that you give the text of the question,
                  choose the answer type, dependencies, and where the question appears in the
                  survey.</p>
                <p>The large text area is where you give the text of your question. What you write
                  here depends on the kind of survey you are creating, but you should be descriptive
                  with your question and always check for spelling and grammar mistakes. Then,
                  based upon the type of question you're adding, you can set the other properties
                  of the question.</p>
                <p>Each question must be assigned a specific answer type. Answer types are created
                  separately from the questions as there may be multiple questions that will use
                  the same answer type. This way you only have to create the answer type once
                  and use it for all of the questions.</p>
                <p>The list of answer blocks can be shown multiple times. Most questions will
                  only require the answer block to be shown once. The only useful time I've used
                  more than once answer block is for showing three text boxes along with a question
                  such as &quot;List three things that could be improved&quot;. Most multiple
                  choice questions will not need more than one answer block but the option is
                  there depending upon the type of survey you are creating.</p>
                <p>When creating a new question you also specify how many answers should be required
                  from the user. This number is related to the number of answer blocks you chose
                  to show and the type of question. If you chose to display three answer blocks,
                  say text boxes for example, but only wanted to require the user give an answer
                  in at least two of them, then you'd require two answers. If you choose to require
                  zero answers, then the user does not have to answer the question at all. This
                  applies to multiple choice and text answers.</p>
                <p>For a normal multiple choice question you would display one answer block and
                  require one answer if you want the user to be required to answer this question
                  or leave the number required at zero to leave the question optional. For multiple
                  choice questions that allow more than one answer, like a &quot;choose 3 of the
                  next 5 products&quot; type question, if you want to ensure the user checks at
                  least three of the boxes, then you would need to require 3 answers.</p>
                <p>You can add a new question anywhere in the survey by choosing what question
                  to add it after or by choosing to make the question the first one. Adding questions
                  in the middle of a survey will not break any dependencies. For instance, you
                  may have a survey where question 3 is dependent upon an answer from question
                  2. If you choose to add a new question <em>after</em> question 1, thus making
                  a new question number 2, the dependencies will adjust themselves. Now question
                  4 will be dependent upon question 3 and your new question will be number 2.</p>
                <p>One of the final question properties you can choose is the orientation. This
                  only applies to multiple choice questions and controls how the radio or checkboxes
                  are displayed. The options are vertical, horizontal, drop down, or matrix. Vertical
                  answer values will be shown with the radio or checkbox followed by the value,
                  each on their own line. Horizontal answer values are shown with the radio or
                  checkbox first followed by the answer value, all on the same line. Depending
                  upon the number of answer values and the users screen resolution the answers
                  may wrap to a new line. Drop down questions are shown in an HTML drop down box
                  with a blank answer as the first choice. The following image shows an example
                  for each type of orientation with the same answer values for each question..</p>
                <img src="doc_images/answer_orientation_example.gif" class="responsive" />
                <p>Questions 4 - 6 were given a matrix orientation. To create a matrix, the list
                  of question, four through six in this case, must all have the same answer type
                  and be assigned a matrix orientation. The survey program will automatically
                  group those questions into a matrix. If you were to insert a new question into
                  the middle, say after question number 5, which had a different answer type, then
                  this would ruin the matrix as it's shown. You may wish to have a question with
                  an answer type of <em><strong>None</strong></em> before the matrix that can
                  be used to describe the questions and answers within the matrix.</p>
                <p>You can also choose to add up to three dependencies to the new question, unless
                  you are adding the first question of the survey. More dependencies can be added
                  later by editing the question. Dependencies are explained in the next section.</p>

              <article id="lookbacks"><h6>Lookbacks</h6>

                <p>When writing the text for your question, you can include previous answers that
                  your users have chosen by using lookbacks. Lookbacks are a special tag that you
                  can place in your question to refer to an answer a user gave. Lookbacks only work
                  for questions that are on a previous page as they require the user to choose an
                  answer before the question with the lookback is displayed.</p>
                <p>By default, lookbacks have the format of {$lookback.123} where &quot;123&quot; refers
                  to the question ID or "qid" whose selected answer will be displayed. For example,
                  if Question 1 (which as a quid of 4534) has a user choose a favorite hobby from Reading,
                  Writing or Arithmetic, you can use a lookback in any question on a following page.
                  Writing a question such as &quot;Why did you choose {$lookback.4534}?&quot; will
                  substitute the actual answer chosen by the user for the lookback tag. If the qid
                  does not match a valid question from the survey or is a question that hasn't been
                  answered yet, then no replacement will take place.</p>
                <p>You can also have multiple lookbacks per question, such as &quot;Why did you choose
                  {$lookback.1234} for question 9 and {$lookback.1456} for question 12?&quot;</p>
                <p>Lookbacks can be used on questions that have any answer type, although using a lookback
                  for a large text area may not be a wise idea. If the lookback refers to a question where
                  the user types in an answer, the text will be encoded at the User Text Mode that's
                  set in the survey properties. This means that you can have your Survey Text Mode set to
                  Limited HTML and include markup in your question, but if you're User Text Mode is set
                  to Text Only, then including a lookback with user supplied text will not result
                  in any user supplied HTML being injected into your question.</p>
                <p>The syntax for lookbacks can be changed by editing the constants in the
                  <strong><i>main.class.php</i></strong> file.</p>
                  
              </article>
              
              <article id="dependencies"><h6>Dependencies</h6>

                <p>Dependencies allow you to add conditions to your questions. You can choose
                  to optionally hide, require or show certain questions based upon the answer to previous
                  questions. By adding multiple dependencies to your questions, you can create
                  complex branching logic so that users may see different surveys based upon their
                  answers. This is useful, for example, when you need to show one set of questions
                  to a certain group of employees and another set of questions to another group.
                  This is possible by controlling the dependencies on each question as you add
                  it.</p>
                <p>When adding a new question, you have the option of adding up to three dependencies
                  so long as you are not adding the first question in the survey. This is because
                  the first question has no previous questions to base dependencies on. You can
                  add additional dependencies by editing the question after it's been added to
                  the survey. Dependencies can be deleted by editing the question, also.</p>
                <p>To create a dependency, you must first choose whether you want to hide or require
                  the question based upon the answer to a previous question. If you're thinking
                  you need to <em><strong>show</strong></em> a question or <em><strong>not require</strong></em>
                  a question based upon previous answers, that's still possible. The dependencies
                  to show a question are just the opposite of what they are to hide it, so that's
                  why only two options are required. For instance, if you want to only show question
                  2 if question 1 is answered yet, then your dependency will be to hide question
                  2 if question one is answered with anything but yes. This works the same way
                  for required versus not required, too. If you want to not require question 2
                  if question 1 is answered yes, then you choose to require question 2 if question
                  1 is answered anything but yes.</p>
                <p>The actual <strong>show</strong> dependency is only useful for Multiple Choice -
                  Multiple Answer (MM) answer types and when used in conjunction with the <strong>hide</strong>
                  dependency. When a user can choose multiple answers and you want to base dependencies
                  on their answers, you must choose to <strong>hide</strong> based upon certain answers
                  and then <strong>show</strong> based upon the remaining. Simply choosing <strong>hide</strong>
                  for MM type questions will not work unless the user chooses each and every one of the
                  hide options.</p>
                <p>After deciding if you want to hide or require the question, you next need to
                  choose what question number to base this dependency on. Remember that you can
                  only choose questions that are going to appear before the question you are adding
                  or editing. Once you choose a question number, the possible answers for that
                  question will be shown. Here you can choose which answer values you want to
                  hide or require the question for. On Widows, hold down the Control key while
                  choosing answer values to select multiple values.</p>
                <p>Any question, except for the very first one, can have any amount of dependencies.
                  However, you can only base those dependencies upon questions that have a multiple
                  choice answer. You cannot choose to hide or require question 2, for example,
                  based upon what the user enters in a text box for question 1. In fact, questions
                  that do not have a multiple choice answer will not even show up in the list
                  of available question numbers.</p>
                <p>Dependencies can be deleted by editing the question. From the edit question
                  interface, you can delete individual dependencies or add new ones. If a question
                  requires more than three dependencies, the additional dependencies will need
                  to be added from the edit question interface one at a time.</p>
                <p>Dependencies could also affect the number of pages users actually see in your
                  survey. For instance, if question two is on a page by itself and because of
                  a dependency on question 1 it's supposed to be hidden, the user will go directly
                  from the page one to page 3. You may want to explain this to users or just remove
                  the page count entirely from your template.</p>
                  
              </article>
              
              <article id="page_break"><h6>Adding A Page Break</h6>

                <p>Page breaks are useful to break up long surveys into manageable parts. To create
                  a page break in your survey, you must enter a certain text in the new question
                  text area. This text should be listed above or around the add new question area.
                  With the default template, this text is provided as a link that'll enter it
                  in the text area for you. When creating a page break, the only question property
                  that applies is the question number that you decide to insert it after. The
                  answer type, orientation, and dependencies do not apply to page breaks.
                  Page breaks can not be added at the end of the survey. You must choose a
                  question to insert the page break after by using the <strong>Insert After Number</strong>
                  drop down.</p>
                <p>Page breaks may be added automatically by the survey program, also, based upon
                  dependencies. If question 2 has a dependency based upon question 1, there must
                  be a page break between the two. This is because we must first get the answer
                  for question 1 from the user before the dependency can be evaluated for question
                  2.</p>
                <p>The number of pages shown in the question list may not be the actual number
                  of pages the user sees when the begin taking the survey if dependencies are
                  used. For instance, if question 2 is on page 2 all by itself and it's dependency
                  says to hide it based upon a certain answer to question 1, then users may go
                  directly to the third page. They will skip over question 2 and page 2 entirely
                  if the dependency to hide question 2 is matched. So while the survey template
                  may say &quot;Page 1 of 72&quot;, the users may not see every page.</p>
                <h4><a href="#toc" name="edit_question">Editing A Question</a></h4>
                <p>Clicking on the edit button in the question list will allow you to edit individual
                  questions. You will be able to edit the text of the question, change the answer
                  type, and all of the other question properties. This process is similar to adding
                  a new question as you're just changing the question properties that you've already
                  set. Note that you cannot edit a question into a page break. You must use the
                  add new question form to create a page break.</p>
                <p>Under the question properties, you may see a list of current dependencies for
                  the question and an area to add new dependencies. The list of current dependencies
                  has a checkbox next to each one allowing you to remove individual dependencies.
                  If you wish to edit or change a dependency, you must delete the old one and
                  add a new dependency. If you are editing the first question in the survey, there
                  will not be an area to add dependencies. This is because all dependencies must
                  be based upon previous questions and in this case there are none.</p>
                <p>Adding dependencies to an existing question works the same as when you initially
                  added a question. You can choose to hide or require the question based upon
                  answers to any previous multiple choice question. Only questions that are before
                  the question you're editing will be listed in the dependency list.</p>

            <article id="answer_types"><h5>Answer Types and Values</h5>

              <p>Answer types and values are created separately from the actual questions. You
                may have 100 questions in your survey, but only use a set of five to ten answer
                types. Creating them separately allows you to use one specific answer type for
                multiple questions. The answer types you create are specific to your survey,
                also. Answer types created in other surveys will not be available unless you
                chose to copy an existing survey. This allows you to customize similar answer
                types and values for the specific survey that's being created or edited. New
                surveys that are created blank and not copied from an existing survey will
                be given a default set of answer types and values that will fulfill most needs.
                You can always add or delete from them as you create your survey.</p>
              
              <article id="new_answer_type"><h6>Adding A New Answer Type</h6>

                <p>The first thing you'll need when adding a new answer type is a unique name.
                  The name can not match the name of any other answer type that already exists
                  in your survey. This name is the value you'll see in the drop down when adding
                  or editing questions. You should use something describes what type of answer
                  it is. For instance, in a multiple choice answer that has values of Yes, No,
                  and Maybe, you could name the answer as &quot;<em><strong>M - Yes / No / Maybe</strong></em>&quot;.</p>
                <p>Each answer value can also be assigned a label that'll be used when users take
                  the survey. This label will appear below the question and before the possible
                  answer values (labels are not shown for matrix questions). You can use the label
                  to further explain the answer values. For instance, if you have a multiple choice
                  question that provides five values and you want the users to choose 3 of them,
                  you may want a label such as &quot;<em><strong>Choose 3 of 5 answers</strong></em>&quot;
                  or &quot;<em><strong>Check all that apply</strong></em>&quot;.</p>
                <p>There are five main answer types that you can choose from. The first is a &quot;T&quot;
                  answer which means the user will be given a large text area to type in a text
                  answer. This type of answer allows the user to type in a lot of text for the
                  answer and should be used if you expect a long answer to the question.</p>
                <p> The second answer type is an &quot;S&quot; answer which will show the user
                  a one line text box to type a text answer into. This answer type is limited
                  to a length of 255 characters and should be used for single word answers or
                  small sentences.</p>
                <p>The next two answer types allow multiple choice answers. The &quot;MS&quot;
                  type is for multiple choices where you only want the user to select one of the
                  possible values. This answer type will use radio buttons. The &quot;MM&quot;
                  type is for multiple choices where you want to allow the user to select more
                  than answer value. This answer type will use checkboxes.</p>
                <p>The final answer type is &quot;N&quot; which stands for none. This means the
                  question will not have any answer values to choose from. This type of answer
                  value is useful to assign to questions that'll act more as labels. For instance,
                  you may want to create a question with an answer type of &quot;N&quot; before
                  a large matrix to explain all of the possible ways to answer. This can also
                  be used to set up a sequence of questions such as &quot;<em><strong>For the
                  following 20 questions, choose 1 through 5 where 1 is LOW and 5 is HIGH</strong></em>&quot;.
                  Questions that are assigned an answer with a type of &quot;N&quot; will not
                  be assigned a question number since they won't actually have any answers.</p>
                <p>Since answer types of T, S, and N all are presented the same to the user taking
                  the survey, there's really no reason to have more than one of each in any given
                  survey. You would typically create one answer type of &quot;S&quot;, name it
                  &quot;<em><strong>Sentence</strong></em>&quot;, and then use this answer type
                  for any question that requires a short text answer.</p>
                <p>If you chose to create a multiple choice answer type, the final step is to
                  list the different choices. You can have up to 99 different values for a multiple
                  choice answer type. While 99 text boxes are not shown by default, it's possible
                  to add more text boxes so that you have as many as you require. Each answer
                  value (or choice) should be clear to the user so they know exactly how they
                  are answering. For instance, don't use answer values of 1 - 5 without first
                  explaining what the values mean. The answer values will be presented to the
                  user in the same order that they are entered here.</p>
                <p>Each answer value can also be assigned an optional numeric value along with a displayed
                  text value. This numeric value is only used when exporting the results to a CSV file.
                  When exporting, you have the option to show answers with the displayed text or
                  with the numeric value. Exporting with the numeric value may be useful if you
                  need to analize the results in another program. If you do not plan on doing this, then
                  the numeric values may be left blank or set to zero. <i>(Note: In versions prior to 1.8.0, this
                  field was known as "Group" and had a different function. Groups were removed in 1.8.0 and
                  replaced with the ability to include this numeric value.)</i></p>
                <p>Each answer value can be assigned an image to be used when creating the bar
                  graph for the results. The bar graph is simply made by stretching the image
                  to certain lengths based upon the percentage of answers. This means you can
                  use a single pixel image as your bar graph image and it'll be stretched to
                  different lengths for each answer value. You can use the same image for all
                  possible values or make them different. Using different images can be useful when you want to
                  &quot;highlight&quot; certain answer values. For instance, if you have a yes or no question where
                  someone answering no may be a serious incident, then you can highlight the
                  &quot;no&quot; value with a red image while keeping other values another color.</p>
                <p>A feature built into the survey system allows you to use beginning and ending images
                  that'll be put on either side of the stretched image. Since the stretched image
                  will look like a plain rectangle, these beginning and end images are often used to
                  round off either end of the image and make it more visually appealing.
                  If you choose to use <strong>anything.gif</strong> as your image, for example,
                  the system will also look for a <strong>anything_left.gif</strong> and/or a
                  <strong>anything_right.gif</strong> image file to be placed upon each side of
                  the stretched <strong>anything.gif</strong> image. If those files do not exist,
                  either one or both of them, then only the <strong>anything.gif</strong> file
                  will be used and stretched to show the bar graph.</p>
                <p>There is no way to define a default answer value when creating an answer type.
                  This means that as users take the surveys and are presented questions with a
                  multiple choice answer type, there will be no default answer value selected.
                  This is to prevent users from just accepting the default answers and not taking
                  the time to select an answer that applies. This also means that if the question
                  is not marked as required, it is possible for the user to not answer the question
                  at all.</p>

              <article id="edit_answer_type"><h6>Editing An Answer Type and Values</h6>

                <p>Editing answer types and values presents the same interface as adding answers,
                  yet you're allowed to edit the name and possible values along with delete the
                  answer type entirely. After choosing the answer type that you want to edit,
                  you'll be shown the current values.</p>
                <p>If the answer type you chose to edit is already being used in the survey, you
                  should be cautious when editing it. You will not be able to delete an answer
                  type if it's being used in a survey, either. If you adjust the actual answer
                  values of a multiple choice question when it's already being used in a survey,
                  you may ruin the results you've already obtained.</p>
                <p>The edit answer value interface will show you the current values of the name
                  and label and allow you to edit them whether the question is being used or not.
                  If you have a multiple choice question, the answer values are also shown along
                  with the numeric value and image choices. You can also add more answer values if necessary.</p>
                <p>While you're allowed to change the type of the answer from the T, S, MS, MM,
                  and N types, you may end up losing results to the survey if you switch from
                  a multiple choice type answer to a text answer and vise versa. It's advised
                  that you only switch between the MM and MS types unless you do not need to be
                  concerned about losing results.</p>

            <article id="access_control"><h5>Access Control</h5>

              <p>Access Control is a new feature added in v1.8.0 that allows you to control
                administrative users, who can create surveys, take surveys, view results, and
                edit surveys by a variety of means.</p>
                
              <article id="ac_type"><h6>Access Control Types</h6>

                <p>There are five different types of access controls you can use for surveys.
                  Access to the admin section, creating surveys
                  (if private) and editing surveys is always with a username and password. Taking
                  surveys or viewing results can be public, restricted by IP address, cookie, username
                  and password or invitation code. Access Types:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><strong>None - Public Survey</strong>: Anyone with that can access the survey
                    program can take a survey or view the results of a survey with this level of access
                    control.</li>
                  <li><strong>Cookies</strong>: Access to surveys is tracked with cookies. Each time a
                    user takes a survey, a flag is stored in a cookie. This cookie is checked each time
                    the user takes the survey to see if they are allowed to take the survey based upon
                    the other access control settings. <strong>Note</strong>: Cookies are stored on the
                    user's computer and the values can be changed. Cookie access control is easy to bypass
                    and cookies can be turned off entirely (bypassing this whole control). Some organizations
                    have privacy policies that do not permit persistant cookies (which this control users)
                    to be set at all. This is not a secure method of controlling access and should only be
                    used in a controlled environment.</li>
                  <li><strong>IP Address</strong>: Access to surveys is tracked by the users IP address. Each
                    time a user completes a survey, their IP address is stored. For each following request to
                    take a survey, the IP address table is checked and it's ensured that the given IP address
                    still has permission to take the survey. <em>Even though IP addresses are stored, there is no
                    way to relate a user's IP address to individual answers given in a survey.</em>
                    <strong>Note</strong>: IP Addresses are not a secure or recommended way of controlling
                    access to surveys unless used in a controlled environment. Some firewalls and proxy servers
                    will change or hide the IP address of the user, so this control can be bypassed. Many users
                    on large ISPs can be represented by the same IP address, so if one person takes the survey,
                    it will lock everyone else out. IP addresses can be spoofed, also, so users could change their
                    IP address and bypass this control. </li>
                  <li><strong>Username and Password</strong>: Access to surveys is restricted by the usernames
                    and passwords you define in the User List. This is the most secure way of controlling access
                    to surveys providing you choose hard-to-guess passwords. Passwords are case sensitive. Usernames
                    and passwords are only used for the survey they are created within. This means that different surveys
                    can have the same usernames and passwords, but not necessarily the same privileges.</li>
                  <li><strong>Invitation Only (Email)</strong>: Access to surveys is controlled by the user supplying
                    a unique invitation code that is emailed to them. This permission requires a seperate <strong>Invitee</strong>
                    list to be maintained. This is a secure method of controlling access to surveys if you use
                    at least an 8 character alphanumeric invitation code. Using an English-word code makes the
                    code easier to remember and type, but lessons security.</li>
                </ol>
                
              </article>
              
              <article id="ac_hidden"><h6>Hidden Survey Control</h6>

                <p>Surveys can optionally be hidden from public view. If a survey is flagged as hidden, it will not
                  show up on the main page in either the survey listing or the Edit Survey drop down box. Users can still
                  get to the survey, results and editing, but it will require typing in the exact URL to each area. The required
                  URLs to get to each area area given in this area for reference. This setting is useful if you're running multiple
                  surveys among users and do not with to advertise what the different surveys are.</p>

              <article id="ac_public_results"><h6>Public Results</h6>

                <p>If the results of a survey are public, then no access controls are imposed and anyone can view them,
                  perform searches and filters. If this flag is set, then access to the results is restricted by the
                  same method as access to taking the survey. If the results of the survey are private, only users or
                  invitees in the lists that are given explicit results privileges can access the results. This means
                  they will either have to enter a username and password or their invitation code to get to the results.</p>

              <article id="ac_survey_limit"><h6>Setting Limits on Taking Surveys</h6>

                <p>If the access control is set to IP, Cookie, Username/Password or Invitation Only, you can further restrict
                  how many times the users are authorized to take the survey with these settings. The first part of this restriction
                  is the number of times the user will be authorized to complete the survey and then you set the time limit over
                  which this is imposed. So setting the first text box to one, the second to 5, and choosing minutes in the dropdown
                  will impose a restriction of <em>Allow users to take survey 1 time every 5 minutes</em>. The time spans available
                  are minutes, hours and days.<br />
                  A fourth time span available is <em>ever</em>. This allows you to set a
                  limit on the number of surveys a user can take over any time period. The second text box is ignored in this case
                  and the first text box controls how many times a user can complete a survey. So setting the first text box to 2
                  will mean users can only complete the survey 2 times and that's it, until you either raise this limit, remove it,
                  or clear the record of who has completed the survey.</p>

              <article id="ac_clear_completed"><h6>Clearing Completed Survey Tracking</h6>

                <p>Checking this option and saving the access controls will clear the records for which users have completed
                  the surveys. This means that if they were already at their limit, that is now removed and they are free to complete
                  the surveys again. <strong>No results are removed</strong> from the survey, only the records keeping track of who
                  has completed the survey. This option is only available if you're using IP address, username/password or invitation
                  only access controls.</p>

              <article id="ac_user_list"><h6>User List</h6>

                <p>This is a list of users who have various privileges regarding the current survey. <strong>Ensure you save
                  any changes to the access controls before you edit this list</strong> so the proper columns are being shown.
                  These users are only for the current survey. Even if username or passwords match other users in other surveys,
                  the privileges do not overlap. The privileges for each user are determined by which checkboxes are enabled. If
                  results are private and a user does not have a check in the <em>Results Priv</em> column, then they will not
                  have any access to view the results. The following columns may be shown, depending upon your chosen access
                  control type:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Name</strong>: Common name of user. This value is not required, but can be used
                    in the emails sent to the user to inform them what their username and password is.</li>
                  <li><strong>Email</strong>: Email address of user. This value is not required, but if it is
                    not supplied, you will not be able to send the user an email giving them their username and
                    password, along with links to the survey.</li>
                  <li><strong>Username</strong>: Username is required. This is what the user will supply when asked to log
                    into different areas of the system. This value is case insensitive and must be unique within this
                    survey. You can not have two usernames of <em>john</em>, for example.</li>
                  <li><strong>Password</strong>: A password for each user is required. Passwords are case sensitive.</li>
                  <li><strong>Sent Login</strong>: Shows the date of the last time the user was sent an email with their
                    username and password. Only shown when access control type is Username and Password.</li>
                  <li><strong>Completed</strong>: Shows the last date that the user completed the survey and the total
                    number of times the surey has been completed. Only shown when access control type is Username and Password.</li>
                  <li><strong>Take Survey</strong>: If this box is checked the user will be able to take the survey. Only shown when
                    access control type is set to Username and Password or Invitation Only.</li>
                  <li><strong>View Results</strong>: If this box is checked the user will be able to view the results of the survey.
                    This column will only be shown if results are private.</li>
                  <li><strong>Edit Survey</strong>: If this box is checked the user will be able to edit the survey.</li>
                  <li><strong>Action</strong>: You can check this box for a group of users and then choose an action from
                    the drop down at the bottom of the User List. You can choose to delete the users that are checked or to
                    send them an email with their username and password. If the access control type is Invitation Only, there
                    will be an additional option to move the user to the invitee list.</li>

              <article id="ac_invitee_list"><h6>Invitee List</h6>

                <p>If the access control type is Invitation Only, then this additional list will be available to list invitees
                  of the survey. Adding names and email addresses here will allow you to send them invitation codes that they can
                  use to take surveys and view results. The following columns may be shown:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Name</strong>: Name of invitee. This is not required, but can be used in the email templates.</li>
                  <li><strong>Email Address</strong>: Email address of invitee. Invitation codes will be sent to this address.</li>
                  <li><strong>Invited</strong>: Last date that invitee was sent an invitation code.</li>
                  <li><strong>Invite Code</strong>: Code invitee must use to access survey and results.</li>
                  <li><strong>Completed</strong>: Last date that invitee completed survey and total number of times invitee has
                    completed the survey.</li>
                  <li><strong>View Results</strong>: If the results of the survey are private, then checking this box will enable the
                    invitee to view the results of the survey. The invitee will have to give the same invitation code in order to view
                    the results.</li>
                  <li><strong>Action</strong>: You can check this box for a group of invitees and then choose an action from the
                    drop down at the bottom of the list. You can choose to delete the checked invitees, send them their invitation code
                    (codes are generated when you choose to send them and then displayed in list) or move a name from the Invitee List
                    to the User List. If a user is moved, you will then need to provide them a username and password in order for them
                    to stay on the User List (if one was not already given).</li>
                </ul>

              <article id="ac_invite_code"><h6>Invitation Code Types</h6>

                <p>Before sending invitation codes to invitees, you have the option to choose what type of code you want to send them.
                  One option is to generate an alphanumeric code up to 20 characters long. This is the more secure option, but generates
                  a harder to remember code. The second option is to create a code out of
                  two English words. This will make the code easier to remember and supply when requested, but is created from a set list of words.
                  Even though there are around 113,000 words to choose from, a determined user could write a script to try every combination.</p>
                  
              </article>
              
              <article id="ac_email_templates"><h6>Email Templates</h6>

                <p>The emails that are sent to remind users of their username and password or to send invitation codes are controlled by two
                  template files in the template directory that your survey uses. The <strong>mail_usernamepassword.tpl</strong> file controls what's
                  in the email sent to remind users of their username and password and the <strong>mail_invitation.tpl</strong> file controls the format
                  of the email that sends invitation codes.</p>
                <p>The email templates are divided into two parts, the headers and the body of the message. The two parts are separated by the line</p>
                <pre>&lt;!-- HEADER SEPERATOR - DO NOT REMOVE --&gt;</pre>
                <p>Obviously, you should not remove this line so the UCCASS program can tell where to separate the headers and body.</p>
                <p><strong>Headers</strong>: If you're not familiar with how emails are formatted, the "headers" of emails control who the email
                  is sent to, the subject, reply to addresses, from address and many other options. The default email templates supply two headers, a To:
                  and Subject: header:</p>
                <pre>To: {$user.email}
Subject: Login information for survey</pre>
                <p>You can add additional lines to create new headers. For example, if you wanted to set a default From: address and Cc: yourself on
                  everything sent out, you can modify the headers to something like this:</p>
                <pre>To: {$user.email}
Subject: Login information for {$user.name}
From: webmaster@example.org
Reply-To: webmaster@example.org
Cc: webmaster@example.org</pre>
                <p>At the very least, you'll want to set a From: header so your users or invitees do not get the default for your webserver.</p>
                <p><strong>Body</strong>: The body of the email (the text after the seperator) can be anything you want. You should use this area to
                  tell the user or invitee why they are getting this email and explain everything within it. What you provide is up to you, but the default
                  text shows you how to create links and use variables. You'll notice that you can use variables in the headers, also, as seen by the {$user.name}
                  and {$user.email} variables. UCCASS will fill in the appropriate values for you. There are also variable available for common links that
                  you may want to provide. A full list of variables that are available to use in the headers or body are below (most only apply to internal UCCASS
                  functions, but they are available, nonetheless).</p>

            <article id="choose_survey"><h5>Choosing A Survey</h5>

              <p>A list of surveys and links to the results are shown on the main page. Clicking on any
                of the links will start the survey. You may be prompted for a username and password or invitation code,
                depending upon the access control for the survey. If you have already completed the survey the allowed
                number of times, then you will be shown a message and redirected back to the main page. If a survey
                is flagged as hidden, it will not show up on the main page.</p>
                
            </article>
            
            <article id="welcome_questions"><h5>Welcome Message and Questions</h5>

              <p>After correctly choosing a survey, you will be shown the first question of the
                survey. Version 1.04 of UCCASS allowed you to create separate Welcome and Thank You
                messages to display to the user. For subsequent versions, these were removed from
                the survey properties. You're still able to include the message though, by making
                the first and last question have an N-type answer and put in the appropriate page
                breaks. This makes the survey system more flexible because you don't <strong>have</strong>
                to include the messages now. If included, the welcome message should
                introduce you to the survey and explain it's purpose. It's also a good idea
                to tell the user how to navigate through the survey. Users should not use the
                browser's forward and back buttons while taking the survey, only the buttons
                provided within the survey itself.</p>
              <p>If the survey has a <a href="#ep_time_limit">Time Limit</a> then the user will
                be shown the time limit and the approximate elapsed time. The elapsed time is
                based upon when the last page was submitted and does not dynamically update
                while the user is viewing the page.</p>
              <p>The survey questions will be shown next, according to the order and orientation
                set by whomever created the survey. Some questions may be required while others
                may be left blank. Questions that are required should be clearly marked, but the
                specific marking depends upon the template for the survey. If a survey page is
                submitted without required answers being completed, the user is redirected back
                to the same page with an error message being displayed.</p>
              <p>Multiple choice questions are presented without any specific answer being chosen
                as the default. In fact, there is no way to choose a default answer as you define
                them. This is to prevent users from accepting the default answers without actually
                taking the time to choose an answer. This also means that unless the question
                is marked as required, the question can be passed by without actually answering
                it. Having a default answer would make it too easy for users to just click through
                the survey, accepting the defaults, and will skew your results.</p>
              <p>Depending upon the number of questions and design of the survey chosen, there
                may be more than one page of questions. After answering all of the questions
                on one page, there will be a button or link to proceed to the next. Once you
                reach the final page of questions, the button or link text will change to notify
                you that you are about to complete the survey.</p>
                
            </article>
            
            <article id="save_results"><h5>Saving Results</h5>

              <p>On the last page of the survey (or on the first page if there is only one page) the
                button should say "Finish" or something similar to indicate that this is the final page
                of the survey. Once the user clicks Finish, the results are saved in the database and there
                is no way for the user to change them. The user is then redirected to the main page, results
                page, or a custom URL depending upon your setting for <a href="#ep_redirect">Completion Redirect Page</a></p>

            <article id="choose_survey2"><h5>Choosing A Survey</h5>

              <p>Each survey shown on the main page will have a link to the results. If the results are public, then clicking
                on this link will take you directly to the results. You may be required to enter a username and password or invitation
                code in order to see the results.</p>
                
            </article>
            
            <article id="view_results2"><h5>Viewing Results</h5>

              <p>The results page lists all of the questions and answers in the survey along with bar graphs
                showing the percentage of what answers were chosen. The questions are shown in the same order as they
                are displayed to the user. The possible answer values are listed below the question. Next to each possible answer
                value is a number showing how many people actually chose that answer. The bar graph shows a visual
                representation of the percentages.</p>
              <p>The percentages are not calculated from how many people
                took the survey, but rather how many answered specific question. Remember that if you have questions that are
                not required, then people can skip those questions and not provide an answer at all. So while 20 people may have
                taken the survey, a specific question may only list 5 Yes and 5 No, for example, with percentages of 50% for both
                of the answer values.</p>
              <p>Each question also has a checkbox before the question number. This is used to select individual questions
                and then used in conjunction with the drop down choices to either filter the results, group results, or
                hide and show questions.</p>
              <p>The results page also lists some time statistics for your survey including the average time it took
                for users to complete the entire survey along with the minimum and maximum times. The average
                time before a user clicked the Quit button is also shown. These statistics can be used to judge whether
                your survey is too long or too short and how long people are willing to take the survey before becoming
                bored and/or frustrated and quitting.</p>

            <article id="filter_results"><h5>Filtering Results</h5>

              <p>While it's useful to learn that 20% of the people who took the survey have low morale, for example, it
                doesn't help you a whole lot when it comes down to fixing things. One of the most useful features of the
                survey program is the ability to filter the results of the entire survey based upon certain answers of specific
                questions. This means you can view the results of all the questions but only for those people who chose a certain
                answer (or answers) to a certain question (or questions). If you wanted to see the results of just the males who
                took the survey (providing you have a gender question), you could filter the results accordingly. Going back to
                the morale issue, you could filter the results based on specific criteria to see if you can narrow down where
                the morale issues are at within your organization.</p>
              <p>To filter the results, you first choose what questions you want to filter on. To choose the questions, check the
                checkboxes next to the questions you want to filter by. Then, in the drop down at the top of the page, choose to
                <strong>Filter on Checked Questions</strong>. This will bring up another page that will list all of the questions
                you chose along with the possible answer values. Check which answer values you want to filter by. Only the results
                of people that selected the exact answers you chose will be shown when you apply this filter.</p>
              <p>You can also filter according to certain dates. This may be useful to compare the results of the first week of the
                survey to the last week. The date fields are automatically filled with the earliest and latest date that a result
                was saved. You can filter according to certain answer values and also filter according to date, or use each individually.
                To filter by a date, first check the box and then provide the dates in the requested format. Now you will only see
                results of the survey that are between the two dates you chose (and also matching any answer values, if you chose them).</p>
              <p>Once you choose your filter criteria, submit the form. You will then be taken back to the results of the survey
                with the results filtered according to what you chose. The criteria you chose will be shown at the top of the page to
                remind you that what you're viewing is not the full results. It is possible to filter the results such that there
                are no matches. If you choose to filter according to a certain age, yet no one matches that age, then you'll see a message
                telling you there were no matches and be shown the full results of the survey again.</p>
              <p>There is a protection feature built into the survey system as explained in <a href="#filter_limit">Results Filter Limit</a>.
                This protection prevents the results from being filtered in such a way as to identify an individual person.
                The filter is set to 3 by default, which means that if your filter criteria match the results of 3 or less
                surveys, you will not be shown the filtered results. This is to maintain anonymity for the people answering the survey. For example,
                if you have a question that asks how long you have been employed and only one person has been employed for less than a month,
                without this limit, you'd be able to filter the results based upon that answer and see that persons answers to each
                question in the survey. Depending upon the type of survey you are conducting, this could violate privacy issues and
                make the survey not truly anonymous. It is strongly recommended you do not remove this protection for live surveys.</p>
              <p>To clear the filter, choose the appropriate option from the drop down menu. This will clear all the filters you have
                chosen and take you back to viewing the results for everyone that answered your survey.</p>
                
            </article>
            
            <article id="showhide_results"><h5>Hiding or Showing Results</h5>

              <p>Another feature of the results list is the ability to hide or show individual questions. Whether or not this is useful
                depends on the type of survey you are conducting. If you had a group of 10 questions that dealt with a specific issue in the middle
                of 100 other questions, you could choose to show just those 10 questions to compare the answers.</p>
              <p>To choose which questions to show or hide, click the checkbox next to the question. Then you simply choose to <strong>Hide Checked
                Questions</strong> or <strong>Show Only Checked Questions</strong>, based upon what you want to do. Once certain questions
                have been hidden or shown, the option in the drop down box will change to <strong>Show All Questions</strong> to take you
                back to the entire results list.</p>
                
            </article>
            
            <article id="text_results"><h5>Viewing Text Results</h5>

              <p>Answers for questions that allow the user to type in a response are shown on a separate page. From the main
                results listing, you'll just be shown how many text results there are along with a link to view them. Clicking
                on this link will bring you to another page that lists the individual results. The text results are ordered from
                the latest result to the earliest, so that's why the numbers actually count down. This way text answer #5 stays
                text answer #5 even after additional people provide answers.</p>
              <p>The results are broken up into separate pages depending upon a configuration value explained in
                <a href="#results_per_page">Text Results Per Page</a>. If there are more answers than this value, there
                will be buttons for taking you to the previous and next page of text answers.</p>
              <p>There is also a simple search feature to filter the text results based upon keywords you want to search for. Note that this
                is a simple search that'll look through all of the text results for this question and try to match exactly what you
                put in the text box (although the case is ignored). The means searching for <strong>head</strong> will match <strong>head</strong>,
                <strong>ahead</strong>, <strong>forehead</strong>, etc. Searching for <strong>some text</strong> will match
                <strong>this is some text.</strong>, but will not match <strong>some other text</strong>, for example.</p>
              <p>When the text results are being filtered according to a search, there will be a message shown alerting you to this fact.
                There will also be a button or link allowing you to clear the search term and go back to showing all of the text
                results for the question.</p>
              <p>Also note that some text answers from your users may not be saved at all, depending upon the configuration value
                described in <a href="#text_filter">Results Text Filter</a>. If an answer is given that matches
                a value in this list, it is not saved. This will allow you to get rid of answers such as no, n/a, etc, if they
                do not provide any useful information. For example, a question such as <strong>Any other comments?</strong> at the
                end of the survey is common, but answers such as no, nope, none, etc, don't provide any useful information, so
                they can be filtered out and not saved in the database at all.</p>

            <article id="del_text_results"><h5>Deleting Text Results</h5>

              <p>If you are logged in as an administrator or have previously logged in to edit the survey, you will be shown
                checkboxes next to each text answer and a Delete button at the bottom of the page. This enables you to delete
                individual answers from the text results of the survey. Check the answers you'd like to delete and press the
                Delete button to remove those answers. There is confirmation of your choices, so ensure you've checked the
                correct answers. If you hit the delete button without any boxes checked, then nothing is deleted. This delete
                function should only be used to remove inappropriate answers provided to your questions and not to remove
                comments that do not fit a particular view or answer type.</p>
              <h4><a href="#toc" name="table_results">Table Results View</a></h4>
              <p>This view of the results will show a table where each user's results are shown on a row of the table. This will
                basically give you an overall view of all answers provided to your survey. If you are asking for name and/or email
                address, for example, a scan of that column would tell you who answered your survey. Any filters that were applied
                to the results will be carried over into this view, also.</p>
              <img src="doc_images/table_result_view.jpg" class="responsive" />
              <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This table can be VERY large if there are many answers to your survey. This view is going
                to show you ALL of the results. If there are a lot of answers to your survey, this view is going to be too much data
                to really be useful. It's recommended you export the results to a CSV file and process it that way.</p>
              
            </article>
            
            <article id="csv_export"><h5><a href="#toc" name>CSV Export</a></h5>

              <p>Clicking on this link will trigger a download of the results to the survey in a CSV (comma separated values) file.
                This file can then be opened using a spreadsheet or statistics analysis program for further processing. The CSV file
                will basically resemble the <a href="#table_results">Table Results View</a> but it can be opened with a separate program.
                You have the option of exporting the results as text or numeric. A text export will show the display values for the answers
                the user has chosen, such as Yes, No, Maybe, etc. A numeric export will just export the numeric value that was set for
                each answer value instead of the actual text. This may be useful if you want to export the results and use them in another
                analysis program.</p>
              <p>Any filters applied to the results will also be applied to this export.
                If you have many results to a survey, this file can be VERY large and take a while to export. The script allows
                2 minutes to complete the export, so wait at least that long for the export to complete before troubleshooting.</p>
              <p>The date and time field for the CSV file may show up in scientific notation, such as 2.003E13, depending upon the
                program that you view this CSV file in. This can generally be fixed by formatting the column as a number with zero
                decimal points or even as text, but it will depend upon your program. Other columns may appear with leading zeros stripped,
                also, but this is again because of the formatting of your CSV viewer. UCCASS will export the results exactly as you
                see in the Table View.</p>

              <p>As explained in <a href="#filter_results">Filtering Results</a>, the results of a survey
                can be filtered based upon certain answers to specific questions. When using this filter, however, it
                would be possible to filter the results according to specific criteria so that the results of an
                individual user would be shown. This could violate any anonymity the users have when they take a survey.
                This setting should be a number that controls a lower limit on the filter. If certain filter criteria
                limits the number of survey results to this number or less, the filtered results are not shown. For example,
                if you have one female in your organization and you choose to filter the results based upon those that
                answered female for the gender question, you'd be able to view the results she gave to every other question.
                This limit would prevent the results from being shown to protect the anonymous nature of a survey.</p>

                Any further analysis or actions based upon the IP addresses will have to be implemented on your own.</p>

                saved in the database. This allows you to get rid of answers that do not provide any information. For example,
                a question such as <strong>Any other comments?</strong> is common to have at the end of the survey. Answers
                such as no, nope, none, n/a, etc, do not provide any useful information so they can be filtered out and not saved
                if included in this list. If this list is empty, then all answers will be saved.</p>

            <article id="text_modes"><h5>Survey and User Text Modes</h5>

              <p>These settings control the rendering of text supplied for the survey properties,
                questions, answer values, and user supplied text. The Survey Text Mode setting
                applies to any text used to create the survey, such as name, questions, and answer values.
                User Text Mode applied to any text supplied by users as they answer the surveys. If you
                do not have any text answers in your survey, then the User Text Mode will not affect anything.
                There are three options for each mode. The setting in the configuration file represents the
                <strong>maximum</strong> value that can be used on a per-survey basis. This means that if you
                set each one to Limited HTML, then when surveys are created, they will not be able to use
                the Full HTML mode.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Text Only: Any text provided will be shown exactly as it's typed. Any HTML code that's
                    included will be shown as plain text and not be rendered within the browser. This is the
                    <strong>recommended setting</strong> for User Text Mode for security reasons.</li>
                <li>Limited HTML: This mode will allow the use of b, i, u, div, span, a, and img HTML tags
                    with restrictions on what attributes can be used with each tag. The restriction on attributes
                    is enforced so that <i>onchange</i>, <i>onmouseover</i>, etc JavaScript code cannot be injected
                    into these limited HTML tags. This is the recommended setting for Survey Text Mode so that
                    you can use additional formatting within your questions and answer values.</li>
                <li>Full HTML: <strong>Warning:</strong> Full HTML is a security risk unless used in a controlled
                    environment. The Full HTML setting will render any and all HTML, JavaScript, DHTML, etc that's
                    supplied in the text. In a controlled environment, this may be useful for including tables, code examples,
                    etc within your surveys, but it can be abused. Injected JavaScript could be used to steal cookies,
                    redirect users, and change any page content. This setting should <strong>never</strong> be used
                    for the User Text Mode.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>These settings can be changed back and forth after the survey has been created. If you use Limited HTML
                and create a question that includes images, for example, then switch to Text Only, the actual HTML code
                will be displayed within the question and not rendered in the browser. The user will see &lt;b&gt;bold text&lt;/b&gt;
                instead of <b>bold text</b>.</p>
              <p>With the Limited HTML and Full HTML options, you have two placeholders that you can use in your questions
                and/or answers. The first is {$html} will will resolve to the HTTP address of your current installation such
                as http://www.bigredspark.com/survey. {$images_html} will resolve to the images folder of the current template
                such as http://www.bigredspark.com/survey/templates/Default/images. So if you wanted to make a link to another survey
                within a question, you could use &lt;a href=&quot;{$html}/survey.php?sid=55&quot;&gt;Click Here&lt;/a&gt;. If you
                wanted to include images in your questions or answer values, you can place them in the images/ folder of your
                template and refer to them as &lt;img src=&quot;{$images_html}/aquabar.gif&quot;&gt;. If you change templates, you
                do not have to change these placeholders so long as the images are also available in the new template. Users can
                also use these placeholder in their answers but it's up to you to inform them (or rather not inform them) of their ability to use them.</p>

            <article id="date_format"><h5>Date Format</h5>

              <p>This is the default date format used to create the date and times in the Results Table view
                and CSV exports. This value is also used to display the survey creation date/time on the
                survey properties page. This setting can be changed on a per-survey basis for the Table view
                and CSV exports. This setting must match the specifications given for the
                <a href="http://www.php.net/date">PHP date()</a> function.</p>
            
            </article>
            
            <article id="database_settings"><h5>Database Settings</h5>

              <p>This section controls how the program connects to the database used to save all of the survey information
                and results. The <strong>db_type</strong> setting controls what type of database system is being used and
                is set to MySQL by default. With ADOdb, the survey system should be able to use multiple database types, but
                it has only been tested with MySQL at this point. The <strong>db_host</strong> setting should be a hostname
                or IP address of the database server and is set to localhost by default. The following settings control
                what username and password the program should use to connect to the database and what actual database it should use.
                The final configuration setting,</p>
              <p><strong>db_tbl_prefix</strong> allows you to set a prefix for each table
                the survey system uses. If the survey program is installed using the web based installation, this value will
                be used when all of the tables are created. If you are using the manual installation and you want to include
                a table prefix, you will need to create the prefixes on your tables manually. This setting allows the survey
                system to be installed into an existing database and be given a unique prefix so that it does not interfere with any
                already existing tables.</p>

            <article id="character_set"><h5>Character Set</h5>

              <p>This allows the use of alternate character sets including UTF-8 and BIG5, for example. These character sets allow the use of
                foreign language characters such as Chinese, Japanese and Arabic.</p>
              <p>The available character sets are limited to those supported by MySQL <strong>and</strong> the PHP function
                <a href="http://www.php.net/htmlentities">htmlentities()</a>. Only character sets common amongst the two
                can be used with UCCASS. The available options are shown below.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>ISO-8859-1 - Western European (default)</li>
                <li>UTF-8 - ASCII compatible multi-byte 8-bit Unicode</li>
                <li>cp1251 - Windows specific Cyrillic charset</li>
                <li>KOI8-R - Russian</li>
                <li>BIG5 - Traditional Chinese, mainly used in Taiwan</li>
                <li>gb2312 - Simplified Chinese, national standard character set</li>
                <li>Shift_JIS - Japanese</li>
              </ul>
              <p>ISO-8859-1 (or Latin1 in MySQL) is the default and recommended for English sites. This character set is what
                most web sites use and include the common English letters, numbers, symbols, etc. If your site caters to an
                international crowd, UTF-8 is recommended as it will allow a greater number of characters to be used both when
                creating surveys and when users provide answers.</p>

            <article id="smarty_adodb"><h5>Smarty and ADOdb Paths</h5>

              <p>These settings are blank by default and will cause the survey system to use the versions of Smarty and ADOdb
                included with all of the other files. If you already have an installation of Smarty or ADOdb, though, you can
                give the complete path to the Smarty or ADOdb directories and the survey system will look there for the include
                files. The survey system is only tested with the versions of Smarty and ADOdb included with the package, though.
                Attempting to use another earlier or later version may cause the survey system to malfunction.</p>

          <article id="site_templates"><h4>Site Templates</h4>

            <p>The survey system makes use of the <a href="http://smarty.php.net">Smarty</a> template engine to separate all of the
              presentation files from the PHP code files. The main site and admin area can be assigned a certain template and individual
              surveys can be assigned different templates as they are created. The template choices are controlled by the
              names of the directories in the templates/ directory. The default template is named &quot;Default&quot; and the
              templates/Default directory contains all of the files that controls what that template looks like and all of the images that
              are used with that template. Any additional directories that are created within the templates/ directory will be
              assumed to contain template files.</p>
            <p>Additional templates can be created to give your survey system site its own look or to integrate it into your
              own design. Simply copy an existing template to a new directory and modify to your liking. Each template should include
              an images/ directory, also. If an images/ directory is not found, though, the survey system will look in the template
              directory for any images (to be used in bar graphs, for example).</p>

        <!-- Tutorial  -->
        <article id="tutorial"><h3>Tutorial</h3>
        
          <ol>
            <li>1. The following tutorial will illustrate how to create the example survey
              included with the installation package. The first step is to click the &quot;Create
              New Survey&quot; link from the main page. From there, you'll be presented with
              the initial form to create your survey.
              <img src="tutorial/step1.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>2. Provide a Name for your survey in the first block. This name is what the
              users will see among the list of surveys and along the top of the page as they
              take the survey. Use something descriptive so you and your users can easily
              tell what the survey is for and it's not confused with any other survey.</li>
            <li>3. You must provide a password for editing the survey at this point. You can
              log into the Administrator area to edit any survey, but this specific password
              will be for this survey, only. While I use <em><strong>password</strong></em>
              as an example here, you'll want to use something a little harder to guess.</li>
            <li>4. You also have the option here to copy an existing survey. This will copy
              all messages, questions, and dependencies from the old survey to the new one.
              This is useful if you run similar surveys and just want to change a few questions.
              Now you will not have to recreate the entire survey over again to do so.</li>
            <li>5. After clicking <em><strong>Next Step</strong></em>, you'll be taken to the
              Survey Properties page. You essentially have created an empty survey that you
              are now editing in order to add messages and questions.</li>
            <li>6. The next page you are brought to allows you to change any of the survey
              properties. The first property is the name, which you've already given. Next,
              you can activate or inactivate your survey and you can optionally choose to include a start and end date
              for this survey or just automatically make it active. If no dates are given,
              the survey will be controlled by the Active/Inactive status. If dates are given,
              the survey will only be available if it's also marked as Active and the date
              is between the dates you specify. Making a survey inactive or passing the end
              date does not affect the answers to the survey that have already been given.</li>
            <li>7. You can choose a template to use for this survey. This template will take effect
              when users begin to take your survey or when they are viewing the results. The next option
              allows you to set the text mode for the survey. The administrator may have limited what
              text modes you are allowed to choose from. You can also set the action to be taken
              when the user finishes your survey. The can be returned to the main page, the results
              page or sent to a custom URL that you provide. For the example survey, I've set
              both text modes to Text Only and the completion page to redirect back to the Main Page.</li>
            <li>8. You also control the survey access from this page. You have the option to
              make the survey public, meaning everyone will see it in the list of surveys
              and anyone can take it, or you can choose to have it protected by a password.
              The same options are available regarding the results of the survey. It's possible
              to have a public survey, yet private results. For the example survey, I've chosen
              to have public access to both the survey and the results. Mark this survey as
              active and allow public access to both the survey and the results.</li>
            <li>9. Press <em><strong>Save Changes</strong></em> at the bottom of the page to
              save our changes. Then click on <em><strong>Edit Questions</strong></em> to
              begin adding questions to the survey. You'll notice there are currently no questions
              in your survey and you have the option to add the first question using the form
              at the bottom of the page.
              <img src="tutorial/step4.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>10. For the first question, I'm going to ask the user to &quot;Please choose
              your Gender:&quot;. Once you have the text of the question, you need to choose
              an answer type. (Click <a href="#answer_type">here</a> for an example of how
              to create answer types.) We want an answer type of <em><strong>Gender</strong></em>
              for this question that'll have the options of Male or Female.</li>
            <li>11. Choose to display just one answer block, which will display one set of
              radio buttons with options for Male and Female. The option is there to display
              more answer blocks (with the same choices of Male or Female) if your questions
              require it.</li>
            <li>12. The number of answers required is directly related to the number of answer
              blocks shown. Since we're showing one answer block and we want to require that
              the users answer this question when taking the survey, choose to also require
              one answer. This will force the user to choose either Male or Female when taking
              the survey.</li>
            <li>13. The last option you have is where to place the new question you're adding.
              Since there are no questions currently in the survey, the only option is to
              add this question first. This will normally default to the last question in
              the survey so that new questions are added onto the end of the survey.</li>
            <li>14. <strong>NOTICE:</strong> As of version 0.95.4, there is a final option
              for each question that's the Answer Display Orientation, with options of Vertical,
              Horizontal, Drop down, and Matrix. These only apply to the multiple choice questions.
              Vertical and Horizontal apply to the direction that the checkboxes or radio
              buttons will be displayed along with the answers. Drop down means the answers
              will be presented in a drop down &lt;select&gt; box with the first answer being
              blank. If a sequence of questions are all assigned the same answer type and
              given a Matrix orientation, then the questions and answers will be presented
              in a grid similar to the following image. To match the example survey included
              with the package, questions 4 - 6 should be assigned a Matrix orientation.
              <img src="tutorial/matrix.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>15. Click Add New Question to add this gender question to the survey.
              <img src="tutorial/step5.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>16. You'll now see that you have question number 1 in your survey. The listing
              of questions shows you the text of the question and gives you the option to
              delete the question (check the box first), edit the question (edit the text
              or change the answer type, etc), or move the question up or down.</li>
            <li>17. Next we're going to add a question two questions, one only shown to users
              who answered Male for question one, and another for users who answered Female.
              <img src="tutorial/step6.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>18. We're going to ask the guys &quot;Do you like to fish?&quot; with an answer
              type of &quot;Yes / No&quot;, one answer block, zero answers required, and insert
              the new question after question number one. To make this question only show
              up to users who answered Male for question one, we'll need to include a dependency
              with this question before adding it.
              <img src="tutorial/step7.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>19. The dependency we'll add is to &quot;Hide&quot; the new question if question
              &quot;1&quot; is answers with &quot;Female&quot;.</li>
            <li>20. Click on <em><strong>Add New Question</strong></em> and you'll be presented
              with the updated list of questions in your survey.
              <img src="tutorial/step8.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>21. Notice that the program automatically added a page break before question
              number 2. This is required because it needs the user to answer question one
              before it can determine whether or not to hide question 2. If you try to delete
              this page break or move the question up to the first page, you'll get an error.
              Notice how the dependencies for the new question are also listed.</li>
            <li>22. For question number 3, we're only going to show it to users who answered
              Female for question one.
              <img src="tutorial/step9.jpg" class="responsive" />
              <img src="tutorial/step10.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>23. This is another Yes / No question with one answer block, no answer required,
              and inserted after question 2. We'll create a dependency similar to question
              2, hiding the new question if question one is answered with Male.
              <img src="tutorial/step11.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>24. You should now see three questions in your survey and one page break. Notice
              that another page break was not added when we added question 3. Question 3 is
              dependent upon the answer to question one and since question one is already
              on another previous page, there's no need to add another page break.</li>
            <li>25. For question 4, we'll be asking the user &quot;What is your favorite hobby?&quot;
              with an answer type of <em><strong>Sentence</strong></em>, one answer block,
              zero answers required, and inserted after question 3.
              <img src="tutorial/step12.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>26. A <em><strong>Sentence</strong></em> answer type will show a normal text
              box to the user to enter their answer in and allow 255 characters. If the answer
              requires more room, you can choose a <em><strong>Text box (Large)</strong></em>
              which does not have a limit on the length of the answer</li>
            <li>27. Question 5 is not actually going to be a question, it'll be more of a label:
              &quot;For the following questions, please rate the food at the restaurants listed.&quot;.
              You'll add the question in the normal way with an answer type of <em> <strong>None</strong></em>.
              The number of answer blocks and answers required is irrelevant since there won't
              actually be any answers shown. Although we're not going to create any at this
              time, you can place dependencies upon this &quot;question&quot;.
              <img src="tutorial/step13.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>28. After adding this question to your survey, you should see a question list
              like this:
              <img src="tutorial/step14.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>29. Notice that for the question just entered, it is not assigned a question
              number. Questions with an answer type of <em><strong>None</strong></em> are
              basically treated as labels and do not take up a question number. Then can be
              moved around the survey and have dependencies, though</li>
            <li>30. The first restaurant we'll list will be Question 5, &quot;McDonalds&quot;.
              Choose an answer type of Good / Okay / Bad with one answer block and zero answers
              required.
              <img src="tutorial/step15.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>31. Notice that you can only insert the question after question 4, which means
              it's actually going to appear before the &quot;label&quot; we just added. This
              isn't a problem, though, as we'll just use the down arrow button <img src="tutorial/down_arrow_button.jpg" width="40" height="23">
              to move question 5 after it's added. After doing so, you should end up with
              a question list ending in this:
              <img src="tutorial/step16.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>32. Now add two more restaurant questions, &quot;Burger King&quot; and &quot;KFC&quot;
              with <em><strong>Good / Okay / Bad</strong></em> answer type, one answer block,
              and zero answers required. Add these as question 6 and question 7</li>
            <li>33. You should finally end up with a 7 question list like this:
              <img src="tutorial/step17.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>34. At this point we only have two pages in the survey. It would be nice to
              separate the gender questions from the restaurant questions, so we're going
              to add a page break after question 4. To make a page break, you need to enter
              the exact text listed above the question text box. If this text is a link, you
              can click on it to fill the text box for you. The answer type, answer blocks,
              and required will be ignored. Be sure to insert the page break after question
              4.
              <img src="tutorial/step18.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>35. You should now see a page break after question 4 in the list</li>
            <li>36. Next we'll add a group of similar questions. If the user says that the
              food is &quot;Bad&quot; at one of the restaurants, we'd like to require them
              to give a reason why. Question 8 will be &quot;Why do you think the food is
              bad at McDonalds?&quot; with a <em><strong>Sentence</strong></em> answer type,
              one answer block and <em><strong>ZERO</strong></em> answers required.
              <img src="tutorial/step19.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>37. Now, I know I just said we're going to make this question required, but
              it's only required based upon the answer to a previous question, so we'll handle
              that in a dependency. We're going to add two dependencies to this question.
              One is to hide the new question if question 5 (about McDonalds) is answered
              Good or Okay. The second dependency is to require the new question if question
              5 is answered Bad.
              <img src="tutorial/step20.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>38. Save this question and ensure you see both dependencies listed under the
              question in the list. Notice how the system again automatically added a page
              break since we need to get the answers to the first questions before we can
              determine whether to hide or require this question. Add two more questions asking
              why the users did not like the food at the final two restaurants. You should
              end up with 10 questions, now.</li>
            <li>39. For the final question, we're going to ask if there are &quot;Any more
              comments?&quot; and provide the user a larger text area to write their answer
              in. The answer type will be <em><strong>Text box (Large)</strong></em> with
              one answer block, no answers required, and inserted after question 10. There
              will be no dependencies for this final question</li>
            <li>40. You should now have 11 questions (with one label) in your survey on 5 different
              pages. Click on the Return to Main link at the top of the page and you should
              see the survey you just created listed in the Public Surveys. Click on the link
              to begin taking the survey.</li>
            <li>41. Page one is going to be your welcome message. Click on Next Page &gt;&gt;.
              <img src="tutorial/step21.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>42. Page 2 is going to ask the user's gender. Notice how the question is marked
              with <img src="tutorial/radic.jpg" width="24" height="22"> since it's required.
              If you do not choose an answer, you'll be brought back to this page. Answer
              Male and click on Next Page &gt;&gt;.
              <img src="tutorial/step22.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>43. Page 3 is going to ask out fishing and hobby question. Notice how the question
              about shopping was not displayed because of the dependencies. Answer Yes and
              enter a favorite hobby of your own for these questions and then click on Next
              Page &gt;&gt;
              <img src="tutorial/step23.jpg" class="responsive" /> </li>
            <li>44. Page 4 is going to ask us to rate the food at the three restaurants either
              Good, Okay, or Bad. Notice that if you pick Bad for anything and click on Next
              Page &gt;&gt;, you'll get a required question asking you why the question was
              bad.
              <img src="tutorial/step24.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>45. If you do not answer Bad to any of the questions, then you'll be taken
              right to the final question when you click Next Page &gt;&gt;. After you've
              answered all of the questions, the answers are saved in the database and you
              see the thank you message</li>
            <li>46. Go back to the main page and click on the link after your survey to view
              the results. You should see results graphs similar to this:
              <img src="tutorial/step25.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>47. These results show 7 people answered Male and 8 people answered Female.
              Notice how the number of answers to the shopping question is 7 total, yet 8
              users answered Female for question one. This means someone decided not to answer
              question 3. Since we didn't make it required, this is certainly possible. Question
              4 is a text answer question, so there is a <em><strong>browse</strong></em>
              link to view those answers on a separate page. That page offers a text box to
              also search through all of the text answers</li>
            <li>48. At the top of the page you'll see a drop down with four options. Also notice
              the check boxes next to each question:
              <img src="tutorial/step26.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>49. To only see the answers to question one and two, for example, check the
              boxes next to the two questions and choose <em><strong>Show Only Checked Questions</strong></em>
              in the drop down. Press <em><strong>Go</strong></em> to only see those two questions.
              You can choose <em><strong>Show All Questions</strong></em> from the drop down
              now to go back to viewing all of the results</li>
            <li>50. Once you get more answers to your survey, you'll be able to do some filtering.
              Say, for example, we want to see how males who like to fish answered the rest
              of the survey. Check the boxes next to questions one and two, choose <em> <strong>Filter
              On Checked Questions</strong></em>, and click <em><strong>Go</strong></em>.
            </li>
            <li>51. You'll now be shown a page where you can choose what answers to filter
              on.
              <img src="tutorial/step27.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li>52. Check Male for question one and Yes for question two. Notice how you can
              also filter the results based upon a start and end date. Only surveys taken
              between the two dates will be shown in the results. These dates default to the
              minimum and maximum dates for the survey. Click <em><strong>Filter Results</strong></em>
              to go back to the survey to see how Males who like to fish answered the rest
              of the questions.
              <img src="tutorial/step28.jpg" class="responsive" /></li>
            <li><em><strong>53. Note</strong></em>: When you click on <em><strong>browse</strong></em>
              to view text answers, those text answers are also filtered according to what
              you chose.</li>
            <li>54. You can click <em><strong>Clear Filter</strong></em> from the drop down
              to go back to viewing all of the results.</li>
