# UCCASS
UCCASS (Unit Command Climate Assessment and Survey System)

This project is an attempt to revive the UCCASS project which is available on SourceForge at https://sourceforge.net/projects/uccass/. The project, at this time, has not seen any active development or updates since 2013-04-15 and the official website for the package no longer exists.

This project has been started to provide an opportunity for members of the FOSS community to continue to use, and contribute to the ongoing development of, this tool.
